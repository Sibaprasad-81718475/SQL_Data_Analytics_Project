✈️ SQL Air Cargo Analysis Project ✈️

I recently completed an exciting SQL project analyzing air cargo data to enhance business strategies and improve decision-making in the logistics sector. This hands-on project focused on database management and querying, uncovering critical insights into cargo trends, customer preferences, and operational efficiency.

Project Highlights and Objectives
Database Design:

Created a relational database schema named AirCargoDB to organize cargo and travel data effectively.
Designed tables including:
Customer: Containing information about customers.

passengers_on_flights: Storing details of travel and flight-related information.

ticket_details: Managing ticket-related information.

routes: Capturing detailed data about the cargo routes.

Data Cleaning and Preparation:
Processed and prepared raw data to ensure accuracy by addressing inconsistencies, handling missing values, and removing outliers.
Querying and Analysis:

Extracted actionable insights using SQL, such as:

Identifying the busiest cargo routes and their revenue contribution.
Analyzing customer preferences based on cargo and ticketing history.
Understanding trends in shipment performance across different time periods.

Performance Optimization:

Applied indexing and query optimization techniques to improve database performance and enable faster data retrieval from large datasets.
Technologies Used
SQL: For querying and managing the database.
SQLite: For database implementation and testing.
This project demonstrated my ability to design and optimize databases while translating raw air cargo data into insights that can guide strategic decision-making. It highlighted my technical expertise in SQL and my potential to contribute to the success of the logistics and travel industry.
